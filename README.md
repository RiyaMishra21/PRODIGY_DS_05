# ðŸš¦ US Traffic Accident Data Analysis

**Internship Task | Prodigy InfoTech â€“ Data Science**

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes US traffic accident data from 2016 to 2023 to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, time of day, and geographical hotspots. The goal is to understand contributing factors and visualize accident clusters across the United States.

---

## Dataset

- Source: [US Accidents (2016 - 2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)  
- File used: `US_Accidents_March23.csv`

---

## Analysis Performed

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Time-of-day analysis of accident frequency  
- Weather condition impact on accidents  
- Severity distribution of accidents  
- State-wise accident counts  
- Visualization of accident hotspots using heatmaps on interactive maps

---

## Key Insights

- Peak accident times align with typical rush hours (7-9 AM, 4-6 PM)  
- Clear and cloudy weather conditions see the highest accident occurrences  
- Severity level 2 accidents are most common  
- States like California, Texas, and Florida have the highest accident counts  
- Heatmap visualizations highlight dense accident areas near major metropolitan regions

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Folium (for mapping)  

---

## How to Run

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place the CSV file in your working directory.  
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `US_Accident_Analysis.ipynb` to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
